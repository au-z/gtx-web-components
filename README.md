# Web Components
> Tools and strategies for building a more modular web

## Introduction

Hello, welcome to 2011.

- Increased demand for rich brower experience
- Facebook, Gmail, NYTimes, WSJ

### Can do!

- jQuery, Backbone, Knockout
- Empty body syndrome

```
<html>
<head>
  <script src="/my-whole-website.js"></script>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
```

### Barking up the wrong tree

- HTML and CSS are not scoped, everything is global
- We've destroyed "semantic HTML"
- Offloading our descriptive web apps to JS
- ~~Model driven layouts~~

### No "Standards"

- We're building HTML with primitive data types
- Banging rocks together while the W3C

### Consider, if you will, the lowly \<button>

- Layout, margins, padding, text-alignment
- hover, active, focus states
- click handler
- disabled attribute
- Not so primitive

### Extensible HTML

### Scoped CSS
-
